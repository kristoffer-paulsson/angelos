# Policies in Ἄγγελος

Policies are needed for the security of the project. If policies are not applied properly there is no guarantee that the users are safe.
If users aren't safe they can be exposed to EAVESDROPPING, SECURITY BREACHES, INFORMATION LOSS, INFILTRATION, EXPOSURE TO ROUGE ENTITIES, PERSECUTION and LOSS OF LIFE AND WEALTH.
Policies are numbered according to a certain format for description and implementation reference, this is very important for viability.
Policies are classified into layers of rings and sections, each policy has a serial number chronologically according their implementation.

Example: 1A-0001 Policy description and purpose.
