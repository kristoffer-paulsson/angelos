# Vendors

Download and compile vendor libraries in this folder.
Each vendor library should have its own subfolder with a README.md and a .gitignore file.

The README.md file should have a complete download, compile and install instruction.
The .gitignore file should look like this:
```
*
!.gitignore
!README.md
```
